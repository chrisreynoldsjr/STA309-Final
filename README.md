# STA309-Final
# By Chris Reynolds 
In this file is my STA 309 Final project for this we used a data set having to do with Diabetes this is when your blood sugur or glucose is to high in your body this happens to a lot of people if they are unhealthy and dont eat well. In my project we explore differnt types of varibales those including gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, smoking_history, bmi, HbA1c_level, blood_glucose_level, and diabetes. When doing our models we found that Hbalc_levels were the most significant throught the project even when doing my graphs they were the most prevelant. In this git hub project I also have png files to make my charts better to visualize how much Hblac_levels stood out in the end and also found out that BMI is correlant of getting diabetes and that you should keep a good BMI.
